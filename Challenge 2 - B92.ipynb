    "## What is B92?\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like BB84, B92 relies on the properties of polarized photons. The essential working parts of the protocol are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let Alice's bases be horizontal (H, representing 0) and +45 degrees (clockwise, representing 1)\n",
    "1. Let Bob's bases be vertical (V, represented by 1) and -45 degrees (represented by 0)\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob generate a random bit each, and set their polarizations accordingly.\n",
    "1. Alice then sends a photon, polarized by their 'bit'.\n",
    "1. If they do not match, then Bob will not detect anything.\n",
    "1. If they do match then there is a 50% chance that Bob will detect a photon - if so, then Bob tells Alice there was a detection and they both record the relevant bit as part of their shared key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detecting Eve**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob can do a form of reconciliation where they can take a sample of their bits and see how well they did. \n",
    "\n",
    "If Eve is present, then Eve has to make a guess as to both Bob's measurement polarization and Alice's sending polarization. If Alice makes a detection, then Eve knows Alice's polarization, but there is a 50% chance that Bob will not detect Eve's correctly aligned photon.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, any errors above a given level would indicate that Eve is present, meaning that Alice and Bob can terminate the key exchange safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a handy explainer applet you can use to learn more about B92 - [https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/cryptography-b92/B92_photons.html](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/cryptography-b92/B92_photons.html)"

    "Alice and Bob are going to exchange a key with the B92 protocol! However, Alice doesn't know this, but Eve has broken her random number generator that it now generates output from repeating short sequence of bits.\n",
